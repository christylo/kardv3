# :credit_card: k kard
Introducing the **k kard**, a Konvenient and Kool way to pay. 

### Inspirations
As we are all heading into a future that is going towards paper free, contactless payments, millennial parents are finding it inconvenient to provide their kids with paper cash allowances. Millennial parents no longer carry cash these days. 34% of adults under the age of 50 make zero cash purchases in a typical week according to The Pew Research Center. Unfortunately, cash is no longer king. The question k kard answers is: How do we find a paper free way to provide our children with allowance such that they can learn more about their spending habits and budgeting without having to worry they might face fraud or make an unreasonable purchase with a credit or debit card?

### What it does
Introducing **k kard**, a Konvenient and Kool way to pay.

**k kard** is a mobile application, compatible with iOS and Android that provides a fun yet educational, safe and contactless payment solution such that parents can manage each transaction made by their child through a mobile platform. It is aimed towards millennial parents with children ages 8-12 who want to provide allowance without the hassle of dealing with cash or worrying about unreasonable transactions. **k kard** not only allows the child to make purchases through their own account, but tracks their spending and detects purchases out of the norm to alert parents when there is suspicious activity.
